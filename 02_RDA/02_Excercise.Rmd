In the RDA we performed during the lecture to assess how life history traits of Southeast-asian mammals are affected by environmental variables we saw that VIFs are very high for two environmental variables: precipitation and actual evapotransporation. Exclude one of these variables and re-run RDA.    

- How did the results change?     
- Did the proportion of variation explained by $X$ increase?    
- Is the association between environmental variables and life history traits significant?    
- Partition the amount of variation explained by climatic variables (precipitation and temperature) vs the variation explained by anthropogenic factor, i.e. human population density).
