# How multivariate stats differs from the stats you are used to?   

Linear model  

$y = \alpha + \beta\times x + \epsilon$;

$\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$

where $\alpha$ is an intercept and $\beta$ is a slope.

```{r linear model, out.width= "50%", out.height= "50%"}
set.seed(5)
npoints <- 20
x <- rnorm(npoints, mean = 0, sd= 2)
y <- 2 + x*3 + rnorm(npoints, 0, 1)
plot(y ~ x, pch = 19, xlab = 'Predictor / Explanatory/',
     ylab = 'Response / dependent', xlim = c(min(x), max(x)))
mtext('independent', side = 1, line = 4)
abline(lm(y ~ x), col = 'blue')
```

# Multiple linear regression
$y = \alpha + \beta_1\times x_1 + \beta_2\times x_2 + ... + \beta_n\times x_n + \epsilon_i$;

$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$

where $\beta_n$ are slopes for $n$ predictor variables (denoted as $x_n$).

We are studying population abundance of _Plecotus auritus_ species in 30 different sites, located across the gradient of the availability in roosting sites and food resources (insects). And we are interested to know how these two predictors affect population abundance of this species. 

__Our response variable__: abundance of _P. auritus_.   
__Our predictors__: roost availability and insect availability.

- What if we wanted to look at how environmental variables affect not only the abundance of a single bat species but of several of them, inhabiting same study sites?   
- Say $p$ is the total number of species across our studied 30 sites. And $p$ = 14.    
- So we now have __$p$ response variables__, each reflecting the abundance of each study species.

# Difference between multiple regression and multivariate stats
Multiple linear regression:   
we have 30 sites, in each we study abundance of _P. auritus_ using 2 predictors (roost and food availability, $x$ and $v$, respectively).   

$$
\mathbf{Y} =
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1  \\
y_2  \\
y_3  \\
\dots  \\
y_{30}  \\
\end{bmatrix}; 
\mathbf{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1  & v_1  \\
x_2  & v_2 \\
x_3  & v_3 \\
\vdots  & \vdots \\
x_{30}  & v_{30} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Sites are here shown in rows.

# Difference between multiple regression and multivariate stats
Multivariate stats:    
we have 30 sites, in each we study abundance of $p$ species (14) using 2 predictors (roost and food availability, $x$ and $v$, respectively).   


$$
\mathbf{Y} =

# Applicable beyond community data  
Although several multivariate analysis methods (e.g. CA and CCA) were initially developed specifically to analyse community data, they are applicable more broadly.   
When dealing with other types of the data than community data, sites (clearly understood for community data) are also referred to as objects or samples in multivariate analysis.

# Example I: effects of environment on individual bat condition

__Sample__: bat individual   
__Response variables__: temperature, hormone level, parasite load    
__Predictor variables__: habitat structure, food availability, weather descriptors     
So now each object /sample is an individual, and we have measurements per this individual   

# Example I: effects of environment on individual bat condition

Say we sampled for 40 bat individuals their temperature (b), cortisol (c), body mass (m), and parasite load (l). We want to understand how morpho-physiological state of those individuals is affected by 4 predictors (habitat structure - h,  food availability - f, precipitation -p, and temperature -t).   


$$
\mathbf{Y} =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 & c_1 & m_1 & l_1 \\
b_2 & c_2 & m_2 & l_2 \\
b_3 & c_3 & m_3 & l_3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots  \\
b_{40} & c_{40} & m_{40} & l_{40}\\
\end{bmatrix}; 
\mathbf{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
h_1  & f_1 & p_1 & t_1  \\
h_2  & f_2 & p_2 & t_2 \\
h_3  & f_3 & p_3 & t_3 \\
\vdots  & \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots \\
h_{40}  & f_{40} & p_{40} & t_{40} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


# Example II: Effect of data availability on the model choice for Population Viability Analysis (PVA)

__Sample__: publication reporting a PVA model       
__Response variables__: studied species, social/territorial organisation of the species, availability of the fine-scale dispersal data, etc.      
__Possible predictor variables__:  Is the used model an individual-based model or a more aggregated model like population matrix model?      



# Effect of data availability on the complexity of PVA model
<p style = "font-size: 80%; ">Radchuk et al. (2016) analysed models developed to assess population viability of 37 species. For each species we found a pair of models: an individual-based and a matrix-model.     
__The aim__:  to understand how data availability and complexity of the species life history and ecology affect the choice of the model complexity.</p>

Discriminant Analysis classifying each model using  the obtained discriminant function. “I” corresponds to individual-based model (in black) and “P” to population-based (e.g. matrix model, in red). Discriminant function assigns models to the left of “0” on abscissa to Is, and those to the right – to Ps. Certain models are misclassified by the function.
