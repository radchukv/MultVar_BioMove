```

PanTheria dataset that we used during the lecture has the following variables describing the environment in which the species live:

- 'X27.2_HuPopDen_Mean_n.km2', 
- 'X28.1_Precip_Mean_mm',
- 'X28.2_Temp_Mean_01degC', 
- 'X30.1_AET_Mean_mm'.

Please extract them for as many Southeast Asian animal species that we intended to study (from the data 'Species_SEAsia_02_02_16_fin.csv') as possible (you will have to merge both data frames).

Next, conduct PCA on these environmental variables. 

- How do environmental variables relate to each other? 
- And how do they relate to the studied species? Are some species rather occurring at certain values of particular environmental variables?
- Visualize the results.
